                One of the top tourist attractions of Jaipur, the huge Amer Palace Fort sits atop a small hill, and is
                located at a distance about 11 km from the main city. The magnificent Amer Fort is an extensive palace
                complex that has been built with pale yellow and pink sandstone, and with white marble. The fort is
                divided into four main sections that are graced with their own courtyards. </p>
            <p>As you arrive at the Amer Fort, you will enter through the Suraj Pol; unless you arrive by car, then you
                enter via the Chand Pol. Both these gates open into the Jaleb Chowk, which is the main courtyard, where
                in earlier times, returning armies used to display their plunder to the people. The fort has a number of
                sections, including the King’s quarters, the zenana (where the women lived), gardens, temples, etc.
            </p>
            <p>There are a lot of attractions for one to see at the Amer Fort, including the diwan-e-aam, such mandir,
                and the Sheesh Mahal. Amer Fort is also home to some underground tunnels that connect Amer to Jaigarh
                Fort. A part of these tunnels has been restored, and is now open to public as well. Encompassing all
                this, the Amer Fort is a perfect example of Rajasthani architecture which is a must-visit.
            </p>
