                An architectural delight that has captured the attention of many a ruler and wanderlust, the construction of Albert Hall Museum started in the year 1876. With the foundation stone being laid during the visit of Albert Edward (King Edward VII), the Prince of Wales, there was a lot of uncertainty that revolved around the actual purpose of this structure. </p>
            <p>#Trivia- It also known as Government Central Museum and is located in Ram Niwas garden. <br>
                After a lot of brainstorming, it was the suggestion of Dr. Thomas Holbein Hendley, the then resident surgeon, to utilise this space to display the craftsmanship of local artisans. A thought that created interest in Sawai Madho Singh II in 1880, led to the, now gorgeous, construction of a museum of Industrial Arts for the locals.    
            </p>
            <p>Although a small museum was opened in the year 1881, within the premises, it was not until 1887 that the construction of Albert Hall Museum was completed. It was designed by architect Samuel Swinton Jacob with assistance by Mir Tujumool Hoosain. The museum was a stepping stone to acquaint the youth and visitors with the local artistry and help the craftsmen to improve their craft by leveraging a platform, such as this, to their advantage.
