                Located on the Hill of Eagles, Jaigarh fort was built in 1726 AD by Sawan Jai Singh II. Jaigarh Fort is located at a height of 500 feet above sea level and offers panoramic views of the surrounding. It houses the world's largest cannon on the wheels called 'Jaivana Cannon'. There are various other attractions within the fort like Laxmi Vilas, Lalit Mandir, Aram Mandir and the Vilas Mandir.</p>
            <p>Jaigarh Fort is made-up of sandstones and is spread over an area of 3 km. Made with the purpose of protecting Amer Fort, Jaigarh fort is considered as the strongest monument of Jaipur. Also known by the name of 'Victory Fort', this place was considered as a storehouse of all the war amours, cannons, arms and ammunitions. There is a Persian style garden within the complex of the fort which is divided into 4 parts. The best part about the fort is its windows which are made of lattices. These windows allow a complete view of the exteriors, but nothing can be observed from the outside.
    
            </p>
            <p>It served as the residence of many kings and was also used to store weapons, artillery and ammunition of the Rajput rulers along with other military utilities.

                It was said to be the main cannon foundry for the Mughal rulers. The cannon outpost was protected during the many consecutive wars that broke out in the Mughal dynasty in 1658, until the protector Dara Shikoh was beaten in battle and slain by his own brother Aurangzeb.
